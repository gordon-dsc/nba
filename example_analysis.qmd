![](output/question_1.png){width="406"}

Scatter plot showing the average number of 3 pointers attempted has increased over the years. Note: Vertical line shows when Stephen Curry entered the NBA

```{r}
nba_all_stars |>
  group_by(year) |>
  summarize(avg_fg3a = mean(fg3a, na.rm = TRUE)) -> avg_3_atempt

avg_3_atempt |>
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year,
                       y = avg_fg3a)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue") +
  geom_smooth(color = "black", alpha = 0.25) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 2009, color = "gold")
```

## Analysis Example 2

Top ten players who scored the highest average points in years they were an all star

```{r}
nba_all_stars |>
  group_by(first, last) |>
  summarize(avg_pts = mean(pts, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  arrange(desc(avg_pts)) |>
  head(n = 10) -> question_2
```

```{r}
nba_all_stars |>
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = pts,
                       y = fta)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = ast,
                       y = turnover)) +
  geom_point(color = "paleturquoise4") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "hotpink")
```
